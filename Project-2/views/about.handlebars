                            literally has the power to conjure emotions within humans, it MAKES us feel. In so doing it
                            allows the expression of the unique emotions we all feel yet are unable to convey because
                            trying to explain them to others or sometimes even our selves makes us sound like we should
                            be locked away in an asylum! When the truth of that feeling is really a symphony within our
                            soul. Through our site you will be able to access Spotify and have some of your favorite
                            playlists readily available for you. This will help you to relax and also motivate you

                        <p class="card-text">Soul Stretch. What is it? To put it simply, it’s like combining pilates and
                            yoga into a body weight workout that starts with a single simple stretch and turns
                            into a full body workout that will leave you feeling amazing and loosey goosey. First you're
                            going to find any tension you
                            feel in your body. Begin by slowly massaging the area, trying to figure out where that
                            tightness begins and ends and at what angle it wants to stretch out. Once you’ve figured out
                            where that tension is slowly begin by stretching
                            it back and forth and at different angles, your body will tell you when your stretching at
                            the right angles and youll start to feel some relief. Stretching that
                            muscle back and forth you are also cultivating tension that is going to be used to
                            continue that first simple stretch in whatever direction your body needs it. For example you
                            could start by stretching out your shoulder and then that built up tension might start
                            creeping back towards your spine and up into your neck and then back down into your hips
                            knees and eventually feet where it can then release. The next thing you know your whole
                            body is nice and relaxed. Any stress you were feeling seems to have melted away, and you
                            feel like you are lighter than air on your feet. Another great benefit
                            of this exercise is that you are going to become extremely in tune with your body and what
                            it needs, how it's feeling, and eventually begin to learn how to isolate specific muscles
                            while you stretch. When done properly this stretching will also release </p>

                        <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">Breathing, Elevated</h6>
                        <p class="card-text">We all breathe, true fact. Wouldnt it be nice to get a little more out of
                            each life sustaining gulp of air? Breathworks utilizes breathing techniques passed down for
                            centuries by Hindu Shamans through Pranayama yoga, to relieve anxiety, focus the mind, find
                            inspiration, literally whatever you might need to feel spiritually, emotionally, or socially
                            at peace. When combined with
                            music it can evoke powerful sensations, emotions, feelings, & inspiration. You never quite
                            know what journey it will take you on, but the outcome is always awesome.

                            It employs a two-part breath. First breathe into your belly, then your chest, then out.
                            Belly, chest, out. Belly, chest, out. Start slow and focus on finding a rythm with your
                            breath. This is called the 'Ujayii', or ocean breath. Your breathing should resemble a wave
                            crashing into the shore and then returning back into the depths of the sea.

                            Once youve found your rythm, slowly increase the rate of your breathing over the next 6-8
                            minutes until you feel you are breathinng at about 50% of your capacity. This is where you
                            will really begin pushing yourself harder and harder, increasing your rate another 25% over
                            the next 3-5 minutes. Now give it everything youve got! Don't let yourself slow down and
                            give it your all! Breathing at 100% for the next 5 minutes. Hit that peak and then slowly
                            begin to decrease your breathing. Picture yourself descending a mountain. Once you ahve
                            reached your normal breathing rate, take in a large breath through your nose and hold it for
                            10 seconds. Slowly exhale through your mouth until you are out of breath then repeat this a
                            few more times until your body begins to feel completely relaxed. Congratulations! You made
                            it! Now enjoy the fruits of all that effort.

                            It works simply through altering the gas exchange within your lungs. When done correctly it
                            activates your Pineal gland producing some amazing effects and experiences that will vary
                            every time.
