            <h6 class="card-subtitle mb-2 text-muted">Breathing, Elevated</h6>
            <p class="card-text">We all breathe, true fact. Wouldnt it be nice to get a little more out of
                each life sustaining gulp of air? Breathworks utilizes breathing techniques passed down for
                centuries by Hindu Shamans through Pranayama yoga, to relieve anxiety, focus the mind, find
                inspiration, literally whatever you might need to feel spiritually, emotionally, or socially at peace.
                When combined with
                music it can evoke powerful sensations, emotions, feelings, & inspiration. You never quite
                know what journey it will take you on, but the outcome is always awesome.

                It employs a two-part breath. First breathe into your belly, then your chest, then out.
                Belly, chest, out. Belly, chest, out. Start slow and focus on finding a rythm with your
                breath. This is called the 'Ujayii', or ocean breath. Your breathing should resemble a wave
                crashing into the shore and then returning back into the depths of the sea.

                Once youve found your rythm, slowly increase the rate of your breathing over the next 6-8
                minutes until you feel you are breathinng at about 50% of your capacity. This is where you
                will really begin pushing yourself harder and harder, increasing your rate another 25% over
                the next 3-5 minutes. Now give it everything youve got! Don't let yourself slow down and
                give it your all! Breathing at 100% for the next 5 minutes. Hit that peak and then slowly
                begin to decrease your breathing. Picture yourself descending a mountain. Once you ahve
                reached your normal breathing rate, take in a large breath through your nose and hold it for
                10 seconds. Slowly exhale through your mouth until you are out of breath then repeat this a
                few more times until your body begins to feel completely relaxed. Congratulations! You made
                it! Now enjoy the fruits of all that effort.

                It works simply through altering the gas exchange within your lungs. When done correctly it
                activates your Pineal gland producing some amazing effects and experiences that will vary
                every time.
